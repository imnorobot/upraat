This is a plaintext file for misc. notes related to Praat for the APIL
ultrasound project at the University of Arizona. 

As of the initial checkin (Oct 2), I (David) will keep this on my own
github account. Get in touch if you'd like write access
(I'm at dellison@email.arizona.edu). Feel free to add things; just be
sure to document what you do and why. 

__COMPILATION_INSTUCTIONS__
1) Make sure libgtk2.0-dev and libasound2-dev are installed.
2) From the source directory, type
   cp makefiles/makefile.defs.linux ./makefile.defs
3) make

Obviously, these instructions are indended for Linux (you know how to use Linux, don't you?)
